Example Notebooks
*****************

The files and directories located here are examples on how to interact with the Observatory Control System Components and Environment, including the DM stack. The notebooks are separated into directories based on their functionality. Short descriptions of each directory are as follows:


Operations: 
        Notebooks containing examples of how to perform activies while observing or actively using the telescope. This could include taking an image, PSF analysis (focus), curvature wavefront sensing etc.

EFD_data_analysis: 
        Notebooks that mine the EFD and perform analysis. No interaction with the control system is required
