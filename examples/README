The directories located here are used to differentiate between the types of notebooks that one may use for working with LSST. Short descriptions of each directory are as follows:

Operations: Notebooks containing examples of how to perform activies while observing or actively using the telescope. This could include taking an image, PSF analysis (focus), curvature wavefront sensing etc.

EFD_data_analysis: Notebooks that mine the EFD and perform analysis. No interaction with the control system is required
